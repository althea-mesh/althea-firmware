Althea Firmware Builder
===================

This repo is dedicated to building custom OpenWRT firmware for Althea routers.
Similar to LibreMesh's [Lime-SDK](https://github.com/libremesh/lime-sdk) or
SudoMesh's [SudoWRT](https://github.com/sudomesh/sudowrt-firmware) firmware
builder. All of these perform much the same function, maintaining a series of
config files, patches, and packages to insert into a OpenWRT firmware image.

The Althea firmware builder deviates from existing efforts with a strong focus
on readability and simplicity. There's no reason for everyone to have their
own bespoke tooling to do the same thing, but long bash scripts tend to
encourage that sort of thing by being incomprehensible.

----------

Is this where I get Althea?
------------------------------------------

If you just want Althea on your router please download a firmware release from
our website once it becomes available. This page is for developers who want
to help improve Althea.

Getting Started
--------------------

First off you need a Linux machine with at least 15gb of free disk space,
4gb of free ram and Ansible.

On Ubuntu and Debian:
> sudo apt install python-pip

> sudo pip install ansible

On Fedora:
> sudo dnf install ansible

On Centos and RHEL:
> sudo yum install ansible

Once you have Ansible you can use it to manage the rest of the dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/althea-mesh/althea-firmware
cd althea-firmware
ansible-playbook first-time-setup.yml --ask-sudo-pass
```
Type in your password to give Ansible permissions to install the required
packages. This will also install Rust and add it to your PATH in your bashrc.
We use Rust Nightly, the build script will update it for you. 

If you have a nonstandard setup, or just don't trust Ansible with root
you may want to install dependencies manually using these commands.

Debian:

	sudo apt-get install build essential libncurses5-dev gawk git subversion libssl-dev gettext unzip zlib1g-dev file python systemtap-sdt-dev

Ubuntu:

	sudo apt-get install build-essential subversion libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev gawk gcc-multilib flex git-core gettext libssl-dev unzip systemtap-sdt-dev

Centos:

	sudo yum install subversion binutils bzip2 gcc gcc-c++ gawk gettext flex ncurses-devel zlib-devel zlib-static make patch unzip perl-ExtUtils-MakeMaker glibc glibc-devel glibc-static quilt ncurses-libs sed sdcc intltool sharutils bison wget git-core openssl-devel xz systemtap-sdt-devel

Fedora:

	sudo dnf install subversion binutils bzip2 gcc gcc-c++ gawk gettext git-core flex ncurses-devel ncurses-compat-libs zlib-devel zlib-static make patch unzip perl-ExtUtils-MakeMaker perl-Thread-Queue glibc glibc-devel glibc-static quilt sed sdcc intltool sharutils bison wget openssl-devel systemtap-sdt-devel

Arch:

	sudo pacman -S subversion binutils bzip2 gcc gcc-libs gawk gettext git flex ncurses zlib automake patch unzip perl glibc quilt sed sdcc intltool sharutils bison wget openssl systemtap

Finally install (Rust)[https://www.rustup.rs/] and add Rustup to your PATH

Profiles
--------

To simplify the process of building and configuring the firmware we use
composable variable files in the `profiles/` directory. For example, the
test deployment management profile sets up the firmware for remote administration.

You can easily customize these pofiles for your own needs and the target device.

Building the firmware
-----------------------------

If there is an existing device profile building the firmware
should be pretty simple. Here are the existing hardware config names.

| Hardware Config | Target Name | Full model name          |
|-----------------|-------------|--------------------------|
|      n600       |    ar71xx   | WD My Net N600 Model: C3 |
|      n750       |    ar71xx   | WD My Net N750 Model: C3 |
|   virtualbox    |     x86     | Virtualbox VM            |

To build the firmware for your device run, replacing '\<Hardware Config\>' with
the value from the table above:
> ansible-playbook firmware-build.yml -e @/profiles/devices/\<Hardware Config\>.yml

This will take a long time, especially the first run. Nearly an hour on a fast
machine and several on a slower one. After the first run things should be much
faster due to cached builds. On the order of 5-10 minutes.

If you need to build for another target, just run again with a different profile
parameter.

When finished your firmware images will be located in
`althea-firmware/build/bin/targets/<Target Name>/generic/` depending on what
flashing method you use different files in that directory will be appropriate.

Now that you have the firmware file, follow the OpenWRT guide to
[installing firmware](https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.flashing).
If your device is supported by the `factory-upload.yml` playbook you can put
it into recovery mode and use it in place of `upgrade-firmware.yml` below.
Currently only WD n600 and n750 models are supported.

Or in the case that you already have a version of Althea firmware installed
you can use the `upgrade-firmware.yml` playbook.

First create a file named `hosts` and format it like so:
```
[routers]
192.168.1.1 #or different if you change the default
....
```
Next create a file called `internal_ip_list.txt` that contains the Wireguard IP
provided to you. If you're going to flash a bunch of devices go ahead and populate
the entire list. Generated credentails will be placed into a credentials file created
when you run the playbook.

```
172.168.1.54
```

Then run the firmware upgrade playbook. You must include a hardware profile and
flash only one model of router at a time. Even then I don't suggest doing too
many at once, just incase things go wrong:
> ansible-playbook -i hosts upgrade-firmware.yml -e @profiles/devices/<Hardware Config>.yml --ask-pass

Follow the instructions carefully, it's possible to destory the device if done
improperly and rarely even when done properly. Never flash anything you can't
afford to lose.

Somthing didn't work
---------------------

Follow the debugging instructions provided by the build playbook. That should
give you a proper error message. Drop by
[our Matrix channel](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#althea:matrix.org) and let us
know what happened. We'll be happy to help out.

There's no hardware config for my router
----------------------------------------

Making a hardware config is a somewhat involved proccess. If you can read and
understand the
[OpenWRT build system documentation](https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build)
you should be able to manage it.

If you successfully make a build profile for your device, please open a pull
request.

If you would like to request support for specific hardware drop by
[our Matrix channel](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#althea:matrix.org) and let us
know. We'll do our best to add support.
